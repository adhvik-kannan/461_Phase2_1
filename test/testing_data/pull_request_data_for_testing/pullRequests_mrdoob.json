Intended to allow easier experimentation with wide gamut color, different working color spaces, and HDR canvas support. Transfer functions are predefined at this time, and cannot be added dynamically.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nimport { ColorManagement } from 'three';\r\nimport { \r\n  DisplayP3ColorSpace,\r\n  DisplayP3ColorSpaceImpl,\r\n  LinearDisplayP3ColorSpace,\r\n  LinearDisplayP3ColorSpaceImpl\r\n} from 'three/addons/math/ColorSpaces.js';\r\n\r\n// register Display P3\r\nColorManagement.define( {\r\n  [ DisplayP3ColorSpace ]: DisplayP3ColorSpaceImpl,\r\n  [ LinearDisplayP3ColorSpace ]: LinearDisplayP3ColorSpaceImpl\r\n} );\r\n\r\n// use Display P3\r\nColorManagement.workingColorSpace = LinearDisplayP3ColorSpace;\r\nrenderer.outputColorSpace = DisplayP3ColorSpace;\r\ncolor.setRGB( r, g, b, DisplayP3ColorSpace );\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n🚧 Work in progress. Test failures indicate a bug, I'll need to look into that.",

    "body": "**Description**\r\n\r\nThe `BatchedMesh` currently has no way to remove an instance. \r\n\r\n**Solution** \r\n\r\nAdding the `deleteInstance()` method to the `BatchedMesh` class will allow users to remove instances easily from the `BatchedMesh`. \r\n\r\nThe previous commented out code stated that we would need to implement an `optimize` function to be able to repack the data. Instead, I added a `_fragInfo` array to keep track of 'fragmented' or open blocks. The BatchedMesh will still fill the DataTexture the same way it did before, but once it is at capacity, then it will begin adding instances to open spots in the Texture. \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nThe BatchedMesh has been a pleasure to work with, I just need the ability to remove existing instances. This is my first time opening a PR to three.js, so please let me know if I am missing anything. I am open to any additional changes or suggestions!\r\n",

    "body": "Several loaders were converting model input colors to explicitly Linear-sRGB, with methods like `convertSRGBToLinear`. For future compatibility with wide gamut and HDR workflows, it would be better to target the working color space (Linear-sRGB by default, but may be changed by the user) instead. With this PR, I change the remaining affected loaders to these patterns:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// tells Color.js that the source color was sRGB, causing\r\n// implicit conversion to working color space\r\ncolor.setRGB( r, g, b, SRGBColorSpace );\r\n\r\n// explicitly converts from the given source color space to\r\n// the working color space\r\nColorManagement.toWorkingColorSpace( color, SRGBColorSpace );\r\n```",

    "body": "Related issue: #29200 \r\n\r\nThis pull request corrects the calculations for the logarithmic depth buffer, and ensures proper depth value adjustment for shadowmaps when logarithmicDepthBuffer = true and shadows are enabled.\r\nI found 4 bugs that are causing the issues with the logarithmic depth buffer; I was able to fix 3 of them and write a workaround for 1 of them:\r\n\r\n### Bug 1\r\n**Location** | `NodeMaterial.setupDepth()` in **src/materials/nodes/NodeMaterial.js**\r\n**Details** | In the following line, the variable `fragDepth` always equals \"2\" when a shadow is being rendered, no matter what the actual depth of the frag is (i.e. the `w` component of `modelViewProjection()` always equals \"1\"):\r\n\r\n`const fragDepth = modelViewProjection().w.add(1);`\r\n\r\n**Fix** | The line was replaced with the following:\r\n\r\n`const fragDepth = viewZToOrthographicDepth(positionView.z, cameraNear, cameraFar)`\r\n\r\n**Screenshot** | (see bug no. 2)\r\n\r\n### Bug 2\r\n**Location** | `NodeMaterial.setupDepth()` in **src/materials/nodes/NodeMaterial.js**\r\n**Details** | In the following line, the logarithmic depth calculation is not correct:\r\n\r\n`depthNode = fragDepth.log2().mul(cameraLogDepth).mul(0.5);`\r\n\r\n**Fix** | The following lines were added to **src/nodes/display/ViewportDepthNode.js** (note the change to the logarithmic depth calculation):\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport const perspectiveDepthToOrthographicDepth = ( depth, near, far ) => viewZToOrthographicDepth( perspectiveDepthToViewZ( depth, near, far ), near, far );`\r\nexport const orthographicDepthToLogarithmicDepth = ( depth, logDepthBufFC ) => depth.log2().mul( logDepthBufFC ).mul( 0.25 ).add( 1 );\r\n```\r\nAnd the former `depthNode` calculation line was replaced by a call to the new `orthographicDepthToLogarithmicDepth` function:\r\n\r\n`depthNode = orthographicDepthToLogarithmicDepth( fragDepth, cameraLogDepth );`\r\n\r\n**Screenshot** | *webgpu_camera_logarithmicdepthbuffer.html* results before and after change:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98140564-e952-414d-a75a-321dafa91357)\r\n\r\n### Bugs 3a & 3b\r\n**Location** | `AnalyticLightNode.setupShadow()` in **src/nodes/lighting/AnalyticLightNode.js**\r\n**Details** | **3a)** The necessary adjustment to `coordZ` is not made when `logarithmicDepthBuffer` is `true`. **3b)** The aforementioned adjustment of `coordZ` requires use of the `cameraNear`, `cameraFar`, and `cameraLogDepth` uniforms, but these uniforms do not appear to be using the `shadow.camera` object for their calculations.\r\n**Fix** | The following lines were added so that the shadow `coordZ` is adjusted for the logarithmic depth buffer, with the necessary uniforms correctly using the shadow camera object:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nif ( renderer.logarithmicDepthBuffer === true ) {\r\n\r\n    // the normally available cameraNear, cameraFar, and cameraLogDepth nodes cannot be used here because they do\r\n    // not get updated to use the shadow camera, so we have to declare our own \"local\" nodes here.\r\n    // TODO: can we fix the cameraNear/cameraFar/cameraLogDepth nodes in src/nodes/accessors/Camera.js so we don't have to declare local ones here?\r\n    if ( shadow.camera.isPerspective ) {\r\n\r\n        const cameraNearLocal = uniform( 'float' ).onRenderUpdate( () => shadow.camera.near );\r\n        const cameraFarLocal = uniform( 'float' ).onRenderUpdate( () => shadow.camera.far );\r\n        coordZ = perspectiveDepthToOrthographicDepth( coordZ, cameraNearLocal, cameraFarLocal );\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    const cameraLogDepthLocal = uniform( 'float' ).onRenderUpdate( () => 2.0 / ( Math.log( shadow.camera.far + 1.0 ) / Math.LN2 ) );\r\n    coordZ = orthographicDepthToLogarithmicDepth( cameraLogDepthLocal );\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Screenshot** | image is from a JSFiddle found at https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/29200\r\n\r\nNote: the \"shadow acne\" in the \"After\" image is a GOOD thing to see, since it means the logarithmic depth shadowmap comparison is working as intended. The shadow acne is easily removed by setting `shadow.bias` to -0.0005 or some number close to that.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb68ad2f-0e4d-4c20-9c95-c7d48c8d7373)\r\n\r\n",

A reverse depth buffer exploits the high precision range of [0, ~0.8] and inverts depth to better the distribution at distance. This is not only significantly faster than logarithmic depth (where use of `gl_FragDepth` disables early-z optimizations and MSAA coverage) but more accurate. See the below articles, which visualize this effect.\r\n\r\nhttps://tomhultonharrop.com/mathematics/graphics/2023/08/06/reverse-z.html\r\nhttps://developer.nvidia.com/blog/visualizing-depth-precision\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nAs both a [0, 1] and reversed projection matrix would require drastic changes to sensitive code like frustum planes or raycasting, I've hidden both conversions when setting the `projectionMatrix` uniform in `WebGLRenderer`. It's possible this can be moved to a shader chunk, but any inline clip-space math must account for this mode, and we'll need to add a shader define accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe same is true for logarithmic depth, e.g., https://github.com/pmndrs/drei/pull/1737. I've debated adding methods to packing chunks for these.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nThis example was ported from https://webgpu.github.io/webgpu-samples/?sample=reversedZ and uses a 32 bit depth-buffer.\r\n\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/n69rqj8u\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e21ced89-a1ae-4012-8ce9-ccd561d41a3e\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Not sure if the error listener is really needed but kept it there to be safe.\r\n\r\nEdit (https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/pull/29419/commits/6834f41f074359f9979e64979d88e95488984bbd):\r\nMoved the load/error event listeners to inside the if condition, which keeps the iframe hidden when there's no page selected.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50dd18e4-3b49-42fc-b992-c97bb97d7eee\r\n\r\nI'm new to contributing, let me know if there's anything else to do!",

The default camera is replaced by the camera added in the scene.\r\n\r\nProcedure to reproduce the issue :\r\n- In an empty scene, add a camera in the scene graph,\r\n- Select this camera as viewport camera,\r\n- Then add an another object like a Cube for instance,\r\n- Finally, refresh the page : now, the default camera is gone and the scene camera replaced default camera.\r\n \r\n![2024-09-13_14-52](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4fd3ac7-2c4f-4273-9c33-dbf0a853ccd4)\r\n\r\nI propose a simple fix to avoid this problem when refreshing editor page.\r\n",

If geometry data require a special decompression in the shader, things like ray casting or bounding volume computation won't work on the JS side (unless the engine is modified).\r\n\r\nThe decompression in the shader stage is something that we can achieve easier with TSL in the future so this is one more reasons to keep `GeometryCompressionUtils` around.",

    "body": "So far you can only use the copyTextureToTexture function to copy from one simple texture to another simple texture. But it is also desirable to be able to copy from a simple texture to an array texture and vice versa. That's why I expanded the function a little bit to make this possible. I tested that straight away too. In my app I had no impact on the existing code, but I can now copy textures into array textures. The 1 in line 1450 means that only one layer should be copied.\r\n",

    "body": "**Description**\r\n\r\nThe methods `WebGLRenderer.compile()` and `WebGLRenderer.compileAsync()` fail when trying to compile custom objects that define a `material` property. My use case involves objects that manage child meshes. The composite objects provide access to an inner, shared material via a getter for convenience.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce the error, uncomment line 47 or 48 in the following example: https://jsfiddle.net/7nvcjwk8/\r\n\r\n```\r\nUncaught (in promise) TypeError: geometry is undefined\r\n    getParameters WebGLPrograms.js:77\r\n    getProgram WebGLRenderer.js:1631\r\n    prepareMaterial WebGLRenderer.js:921\r\n    compile WebGLRenderer.js:999\r\n    traverse Object3D.js:536\r\n    traverse Object3D.js:542\r\n    compile WebGLRenderer.js:980\r\n    compileAsync WebGLRenderer.js:1019\r\n    init webgl_geometry_cube.html:65\r\n    <anonymous> webgl_geometry_cube.html:37\r\nWebGLPrograms.js:77\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the `compile` method to only process renderable objects, similar to how it's done in `WebGLRenderer.projectObject()`.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, `Object3D` could define `isRenderable` with a default value of `false` and the renderable sub classes could set this flag to `true`.",

In this case with this feature we can re-use the instance in a clever way updating only their geometryId.\r\n\r\n",

As noted this is a consequence of the WebGPU API.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/pull/29320#discussion_r1743663932\r\n\r\nThis PR attempts to provide a solution to this issue by providing a simple mechanism for the user to return used buffers ( and the related WebGPUbuffer object back to the renderer.\r\n\r\nThis is demonstrated in the webgpu_multiple_rendertargets_readback example.\r\n\r\nBrief testing has demonstrated a reduction in CPU usage.",

    "body": "Related issue: --\r\n\r\n**Description**\r\n\r\nCurrently raycasting only returns a few pre-interpolated results but not all, which can be useful in cases where other attributes need to be interpolated abitrarily, such as when sampling the recently-added Cesium metadata plugins for [3D Tiles Renderer](https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/3DTilesRendererJS). This PR outputs the barcoord of the hit point relative to the surface to mesh raycast intersections and adds a `getAttributeInterpolationFromBarycoord` function to Triangle to make interpolating attributes more convenient.\r\n\r\nCurrently this is the code that needs to be run to interpolate a uv3 attribute after raycast:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst triangle = new Triangle();\r\nconst vec20 = new Vector2();\r\nconst vec21 = new Vector2();\r\nconst vec22 = new Vector2();\r\nconst barycoord = new Vector3();\r\n\r\n// ...\r\n\r\nconst { object, face, point } = hit;\r\n\r\n// get barycoord value\r\ntriangle.setFromAttributeAndIndices( object.geometry.attributes.position, face.a, face.b, face.c );\r\ntriangle.a.applyMatrix4( object.matrixWorld );\r\ntriangle.b.applyMatrix4( object.matrixWorld );\r\ntriangle.c.applyMatrix4( object.matrixWorld );\r\ntriangle.getBarycoord( point, barycoord );\r\n\r\n// get attribute values per vertex\r\nconst uv3 = object.geometry.attributes.uv3;\r\nvec20.fromBufferAttribute( uv3, face.a );\r\nvec21.fromBufferAttribute( uv3, face.b );\r\nvec22.fromBufferAttribute( uv3, face.c );\r\n\r\n// calculate the interpolated value\r\nconst result = new Vector2();\r\nresult\r\n  .addScaledVector( vec20, barycoord.x )\r\n  .addScaledVector( vec21, barycoord.y )\r\n  .addScaledVector( vec22, barycoord.z );\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd this is what it is after:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst { object, face, barycoord } = hit;\r\nconst uv3 = object.geometry.attributes.uv3;\r\nconst result = new Vector2();\r\nTriangle.getAttributeInterpolationFromBarycoord( uv3, face.a, face.b, face.c, barycoord, result );\r\n```\r\n\r\n_This contribution is funded by [Cesium GIS Ecosystem Grant](https://cesium.com/cesium-ecosystem-grants/)_",
